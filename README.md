# DenisonLightLabBuild
This app is still in developing. We havenâ€™t did resolution adaptation yet so it could now only support the resolution of 1920x1080. More features coming soon in spring 2022.
Click a light in the main panel to turn on and select the light, adjust it with the slider. In the light Q panel, you can save/restore the light or taking the notes....
Have fun
